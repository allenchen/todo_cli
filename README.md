## A command-line todo app for hackers

I wanted a todo app that 

1. Was always synced
2. Could be used very quickly - no more clicking around calendar widgets
   to pick due dates. I wanted something I could operate from the
keyboard by quickly pulling down my guake terminal.
3. Allowed me to keep estimate how much time is required for each task &
   track time spent
